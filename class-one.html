    <p>He was confined by his father at Panhala Fort, reportedly for his addiction to sensual pleasures or violating a
        Brahmin woman.[2][3] He later defected to the Mughal Empire and served under Diler Khan in the Battle of
        Bhupalgarh against Shivaji. He ascended the throne following his father's death, with his rule being largely
        shaped by the ongoing wars between the Marathas and the Mughal Empire, as well as other neighbouring powers such
        as the Siddi of Janjira, the Wadiyars of Mysore and the Portuguese Empire in Goa. Early on, Marathas under
        Sambhaji attacked and disrupted supply lines and raided into the Mughal territory, although they were
        unsuccessful in taking over main forts.
        At the age of nine, Sambhaji was taken as a political hostage of the Mughal Empire, to guarantee his father's
        compliance with the treaty of Purandar. He later accompanied his father to Agra where both were placed under
        house arrest by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb; they subsequently escaped. He was later confined by his father at
        Panhala Fort, reportedly for his addiction to "sensual pleasures" and violating a Brahmin woman.[2][3]: 251  He
        subsequently defected to the Mughal Empire and served under Diler Khan in the Battle of Bhupalgarh against his
        father. He ascended the throne following his father's death, with his rule being largely shaped by the ongoing
        wars between the Marathas and the Mughal Empire, as well as other neighbouring powers such as the Siddi of
        Janjira, the Wadiyars of Mysore and the Portuguese Empire in Goa.

        Early in his rule, Marathas under Sambhaji attacked and disrupted supply lines and raided into the Mughal
        territory, although they were unsuccessful in taking over main forts. In 1683, Sambhaji executed 24 members of
        influential families including top government ministers after discovering a plot to poison him.[4]: 106  By
        1685, Mughals had gradually pushed back Sambhaji's forces by taking over their strongholds. Desertions became
        common by the end of his reign, and he had alienated Maratha deshmukhs (land owners) by burning villages to deny
        supplies to the Portuguese. In 1689, he was captured by Mughal forces and executed. His brother Rajaram I
        succeeded him as king and continued the Mughal–Maratha Wars.[4]: 80, 91–95 [5]
